This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard developed using the widely used Superstore dataset. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of retail business performance across multiple dimensions, including sales, profit, customer segments, product categories, and regional distribution.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate advanced Business Intelligence (BI) skills—covering data cleaning, modelling, visualization, and analytical storytelling—while transforming raw data into actionable insights.
